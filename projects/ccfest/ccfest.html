					p5.fab attempts to speak to the apparent tension between the precision & accuracy of machines like
					3D printers, and the messy embodied practices which surround them. The video here shows a 3D printer
					whirring around-- plastic filament is melted in the hotend shown here, which is then extruded
					through the nozzle. We're printing these freehanging extrusions of a single line width are across
					overextruded dots. This wouldn't be possible to print with off-the-shelf software for 3D printing,
					which is instead really good at optimizing the path the machine should take based on a digital
					model. In contrast, the printing the object shown here requires manual tuning to negotatiate speed,
					acceleration, and the amount of filament that's extruded. This requires testing and observing
					material behavior rather than reasoning about in a modeling file.

				<aside class="notes">
					We ran a couple of workshops with both makers experienced with 3D printing & artists who use code,
					and observed some productive ways that p5.fab made experts out of begginers and beginners out of
					experts. For example, the artists had never 3D printed and were able to immediately design & print
					complicated geometry; on the other hand, makers with minimal programming experience had to get a
					handle on coding, but were able to use the machine as a physical debugging platform to test their
					code; in both cases, participants were able to push the machine to weird limits

				<aside class="notes">
					There is, of course, a worry that that the tool gets in the way of enacting the skills that
					practitioners already bring to the table. And in trying to make an accebile community, there's the
					question of what accessibility means in this context, and how to make a tool accessible which
					requires physical hardware. 3D printers are much cheaper than they used to be, but printing an
					artificat will still cost at least 200 dollars more than visualizing it on the computer screen. And
					of course, there are financial and maintenance risks to running arbitrary gcode on shared machines.
