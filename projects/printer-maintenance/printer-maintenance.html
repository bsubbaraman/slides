						Hi! I'm Blair, and today I'll be talking about our work 3D Printers Don't Fix Themselves: How Maintenance is Part of Digital Fabrication. Through a empirical study of 3D printer maintenance practices, we argue that maintenance is a core part of digital fabrication, and that future systems should attend to the messy realities of maintenance.

							We're looking here at a video posted to an online printer repair community asking for help. We can make out in the video that the filament doesn't seem to be sticking to the printer bed. What's supposed to be printed is a calibration print, but as we can see in the final frame here, something has obviously gone awry.

							For owners of machines like fused filament fabrication (FFF, synonymous with FDM) 3D printers, on-demand access to precision parts is a reality. This reality, however, also entails the work required to maintain a machine. Parts have to be calibrated and cleaned, repaired and replaced. For individuals
							operating digital fabrication machines in their home, this implies a
							maintenance practice which is unlike its industrial counterparts.

							We hypothesize that understanding machine main-
							tenance will inform our ability to support current digital fabrication
							practice. Machine and material state play a critical role in tangible
							fabrication outcomes. While software settings can be repeated, re-
							verted, and refined exactly, the condition of the machine ultimately
							determines physical consequences for processes such as 3D print-
							ing, CNC milling, or laser cutting. Maintenance asks practitioners
							to enact skillful, manual knowledge through hands-on engagement
							with machines. We therefore identify maintenance as a productive
							starting point to expound the embodied dimensions of digital fab-
							rication. Furthermore, given that maintenance is often conducted without the explicit goal of then producing an artifact, it also surfaces generative frictions between digital fabrication software and
							how this software is actually used by practitioners. We identify
							home- and hobbyist 3D printing in particular as a promising site
							to begin understanding current digital fabrication machine mainte-
							nance. 3D printing has grown immensely in popularity in the past
							decade, providing many sites of practice. We specifically focus on
							FFF 3D printers, given their widespread adoption.

							In his influential account of photocopier repair technicians, Julian Orr found that printer problems often eluded rote procedure. New
							and idiosyncratic machine failures required impromptu repair using
							skills not codified by directive documentation. Instead, diagnosis
							occurred through a narrative process; the subsequent retelling of
							these “war stories” constituted a critical method for distributing
							experiential knowledge among technicians. Moving our focus from
							printing copies in the workplace to printing 3D models in new
							contexts such as the home, we are motivated by Orr’s work to
							understand how maintenance knowledge is integrated into fabri-
							cation practice. Contemporary fabrication practitioners in these
							new settings share their own stories in online communities using
							text, image, and video. This paper takes their stories as our starting
							point in understanding machine maintenance.

					<aside class="notes">
						Stemming from these intital insights, we ask the research question: How do practitioners maintain their 3D printers? We are interested in how home practitioners gain
						the embodied knowledge necessary to perform maintenance work
						without the presence of a process expert, and what tools help or
						hurt in conducting maintenance. To gain empirical insight into this question, we begin with observations of an online community
						dedicated to 3D printer troubleshooting. We then conduct 10 in-
						terviews and field 92 survey responses from practitioners who
						report sole responsibility for maintaining their machines. Partici-
						pants share with us the work they perform to keep their machines
						running smoothly.
