						Hi! I'm Blair, and today I'll be talking about our work 3D Printers Don't Fix Themselves: How Maintenance is Part of Digital Fabrication. Our paper is interested in how practitioners learn and enact the embodied skills necessary to maintain digital fabrication machines, and how we might develop future systems which are accountable to the messy realities of maintenance.

							We're looking here at a video posted to an online printer repair communit, on the site Reddit. We can make out in the video that the filament doesn't seem to be sticking to the printer bed. What's supposed to be printed is a calibration print, but as we can see in the final frame here, something has obviously gone awry.

							For owners of machines like FDM 3D printers, on-demand access to precision parts is a reality, but this reality also entails the work required to maintain a machine. Parts have to be calibrated, cleaned, repaired, and replaced. While software settings can be repeated, reverted, and refined, the condition of the machine ultimately determines physical consequences for fabrication processes. In this work, we look to maintenance practices to expound the embodied dimensions of 3D printing practice.  
							
							Home and hobbyist 3D printing is a particularly promising site to begin understanding current digital fabrication machine maintenance, since 3D printing has grown immensely in popularity in the past
							decade, providing many sites of practice. In our work, we specifically focus on FFF 3D printers, given their widespread adoption.

							In his influential account of photocopier repair technicians, Julian Orr found that printer problems often eluded rote procedure. New
							and idiosyncratic machine failures required impromptu repair using
							skills not codified by directive documentation. Instead, diagnosis
							occurred through a narrative process; the subsequent retelling of
							these “war stories” constituted a critical method for distributing
							experiential knowledge among technicians. Moving our focus from
							printing copies in the workplace to printing 3D models in new
							contexts such as the home, we are motivated by Orr’s work to
							understand how maintenance knowledge is integrated into fabri-
							cation practice. Contemporary fabrication practitioners in these
							new settings share their own stories in online communities using
							text, image, and video. This paper takes their stories as our starting
							point in understanding machine maintenance.

					<p class="r-fit-text"><em>How do practitioners maintain their 3D printers?</em></p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Stemming from these intital insights, we ask the research question: How do practitioners maintain their 3D printers? We are interested in how practitioners gain the embodied knowledge necessary to perform maintenance work without the presence of a process expert, and what tools help or hurt in conducting maintenance. To gain empirical insight into this question, we begin with observations of an online community dedicated to 3D printer troubleshooting. We then conducted interviews and fielded survey responses from members of this community. We use this data to situate various elements of maintenance in 3D printing practice, and see how more than a just a setback to overcome, maintenance helps practitioners formalize understandings of the 3D printing process and develop craft skill with their machines.

							Our primary empirical setting for this work is the subreddit r/fixmyprint, where posts run the gamut from mechanical repair through custom firmware updates. The site had about 67k members at the time of our study and has since grown to over 100k. Here I'm briefly scrolling through the top posts of this past month. We can see that posts generally include images or a video; in the selection shown here, we can see a question converning aesthetics, or the wavy effect seen on a print, a question concerning mechanical adhesion on a print, on one considering the flow of filament from the nozzle of the machine. And so already we see a breadth of issues that negotiate printer hardware and software.

An overview of our interview participants and their printers are shown on the left here.

					<p>Routines | Repairs | Refinements | Reconciliations</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						We conceptualized 4 main themes which we situate within digital fabrication practice, including the ad-hoc routines which practitioners develop around physically prepping their machines, machine repairs where operators gain confidence through physical disassembly and reassembly, how practitioners use tangible output to refine settings, and finally how practitioners reconcile software which prioritizes digital over tangible practice to manage maintenance concerns. For more detail I of course encourage everyone to check out the full paper, And for the rest of my time, I'll start to dive the nuance of each theme and then discuss some of their implications.

								These routines include tasks which might usually be overlooked as unintersting or boring, like cleaning and tightening screws. P4 notes the importance of cleaning the build plate of their printer with soap, water, and alcohol. We find that scheduling times to do this work reflects broader attitudes towards printing, including compromises between convenience and quality.    

								Over longer timescales, practitioners discuss how mechanical parts need to be tightened and tensioned. P6 described how they're experienced enough to give the machine a visual inspection, where they can check for things like the tensioning of the belts or loose screws. While the printer is running, they're attentive to audiory cues, saying:

								This sort of tacit knowledge of the machine is built over time, and not easily translated from directive documentation.

								Altogether, these mundane acts draws attention to the broader work processes of digital fabrication, where practitioners have to stock not only printer supplies like filament, but also cleaning supplies and spare parts.

						<aside class="notes">
							And finally, all of our practitioners noted that leveling the bed of their printer is crucial to printing success and therefore create routines around it. When printing a model, machine manufac-
							turers expect users to ensure the build plate is level, and while printers increasingly feature automatic bed leveling options, 9 out of 10 of our interview participants, and 80% of our survey respondents, noted that they manually level their bed. A common procedure is to use a piece of paper to define a standard offset between a printer nozzle and the bed; new practitioners noted frustration about this:
							
							Here, P8 articulates the importance of embodied knowledge
							in bed leveling. Despite following a manufacturer-endorsed bed
							leveling procedure, P8 has trouble moving from the manual to
							manual practice.
	
							Across all of these examples, I'll highlight that while generally following manufacturer how practitioners enact routines depending on individual practice. Over time, attitudes, knowledge, and thus maintenance routines, also change.

							P9's first printer came fully assembled. They described using the machine cautiously in fear of breaking something, calling it a 'black box'. While this approach to printing worked for a while, things came to a head when they got a clog in the hotend of their printer. This issue required manual intervention. While the repair in this case was ultimately unsuccessful, they say that physical intervention, as well as the process of asssembling a new printer themselves, gave them confidence to work with the machine more closely:

							From our findings, we argue that machine maintenance is core to digital fabrication practice, not auxiliary. While machine maintenance is often considered a temporary road block in the way of 3D printing, we see in our practitioners’ stories how maintenance helps develop skills productive to 3D printing. Our findings also suggest that attempts to fully automate away maintenance are unlikely to account for all relevant factors. While improved machine design and software can certainly minimize uneccessary labor & frustration, a look to the history of the first numerically controlled machines and other large systems suggests a certain inevitablity to maintenance concerns.

							Instead, we propose design implications which arise from treating maintenance as a core part of digital fabrication. These include treating the machine as a debugging platform so that practitioners can reason about physical output rather than abstract geometry; facilitating manual engagement with the machine; and ways to support the documentation and sharing of maintenance workflows in particular to support distributed practice.
